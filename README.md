# Statistical Quality Assessment & ETL Pipeline Development

This repository contains the code for developing a statistical quality control pipeline for material degradation analysis, utilizing PostgreSQL for data storage and Python for ETL processing, statistical analysis, and automation.

## Key Features
- **ETL Pipeline**: Extraction, Transformation, and Loading of experimental data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Regression models, SPC, and anomaly detection for performance trends.
- **Automation**: Python scheduling for periodic data processing.
- **Reproducibility**: Docker-based environment to ensure consistency across platforms.

## Folder Structure:
- `scripts/`: Contains Python scripts for ETL and analysis.
- `data/`: Raw data files and processed outputs.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory analysis.
- `docker/`: Docker setup and configurations for reproducibility.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for data processing and analysis functions.
- `docs/`: Documentation and reports.
